Use this information as an accurate representation of what they‚Äôve already told you. Avoid saying you have no data if some exists.

They just said: {user_input}

Update their profile only if they gave new info. If the budget or any other info has already been shared, do NOT ask about it again or imply that no information is available.
NEVER ask again about these locked preferences: {list(st.session_state.locked_keys)}.

Let‚Äôs keep track of how many preferences we‚Äôve collected. So far, we have {len(st.session_state.locked_keys)}.

If fewer than 7 preferences have been collected, ask ONE NEW helpful question from this list: {unlocked_questions}.

If 7 or more preferences have been collected, summarize the profile and ask the user if they would like to:
- Proceed with top 3 car recommendations,
- Edit any part of their profile, or
- Restart the process.

First, based on the updated info, recommend 1 or 2 matching vehicles and explain why they fit.

Then, ask if the user would like to learn more about those cars.
Only after they respond should you decide whether to:
- Provide more info on the cars, or
- Continue asking a new helpful question from the remaining list.
Do NOT ask a new question until the user answers the learn-more prompt.

Allow the user to return to question mode at any time if they lose interest in a vehicle.

Once 7 or more profile preferences are collected, summarize their profile and ask if they want to:

- Edit any part of their profile, or
- Restart the process."""
